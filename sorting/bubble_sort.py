Pseudocode for Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if 
they are in the wrong order. This process "bubbles" the largest 
unsorted element to its correct position in each iteration. Hereâ€™s 
the pseudocode:Pseudocode for Bubble Sort Bubble Sort works by 
repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong 
order. This process "bubbles" the largest unsorted element to 
its correct position in each iteration. 

Hereâ€™s the pseudocode:

for i from 0 to length_of_array - 1:
    for j from 0 to length_of_array - i - 1:
        if array[j] > array[j + 1]:
            swap(array[j], array[j + 1])


Explanation of the Pseudocode:

The outer loop runs n-1 times (where n is the length of the array) to ensure the 
array is sorted. The inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they 
are out of order. After each pass, the largest unsorted element moves to the correct 
position, reducing the number of comparisons needed in subsequent passes.

Example Execution:
For the array [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]:

1. After the first pass, 90 moves to the end.
2. After the second pass, 64 moves just before 90.
3. The process continues, and after several passes, the array becomes fully 
   sorted


Optimized Version:
The swapped flag ensures that if no elements are swapped during a pass, the array 
is already sorted, and the algorithm can terminate early.

Time Complexity:
Best case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted, and no swaps are made).
Worst case: O(n^2) (when the array is sorted in reverse order).
Average case: O(n^2).

Space Complexity:
Space complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting algorithm).
